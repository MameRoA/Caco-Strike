Thank you for downloading Caco-Strike! I have dumped a lot of work and ambition into this project and I hope you enjoy the mod.


Make sure to use casmaps_vXX for the vanilla maps.
If you want to make your own, I highly encourage you to, (no bias) and I may add them to the vanilla maps wad if it's decent enough.
All DoomEd Numbers are as follows:

For an authentic CS experience, I recommend these settings. note that you may use basically any settings, 
these are just probably the most accurate to classic CS/CS:GO&2 settings. (NOTE: Crouching is meant to be off at all times, you may use it,
however I highly recommend not to as I cannot guarantee that you'll be having fun. Also going outside these settings runs the risk of introducing bugs
which I may or may not fix depending on what setting is used and how severe.)

PUG/Scrim:







All CVars and default values are as follows:
cs_timer = 2 // this cvar is in minutes, controls the round timer
cs_buytime = 10 //controls how long players have to buy weapons
cs_buytotal = 30 //controls how long players have to buy weapons, includes freezetime
cs_money = 800 //controlls the amount of money players have at the start of a round
cs_bombtimer = 40 // controls bomb explosion timer, in seconds
cs_defusal = false // uses the vanilla teamgame mode, currently the most playtested gamemode.
cs_hostage = false // must use Skulltag gamemode, as the logic from that is used as a basis for the Hostage Rescue Gamemode (Unfinished)
